Goodcorp recently suffered a data breach. The nature of the breach and the sophisticated tactics observed suggest the threat actor is likely an APT. The Incident Response team collected the following from its investigation:

The initial point of compromise was a spearphishing email.
The email was designed to mimic an MFA alert and contained a malicious QR code.
The link in the QR code led to the site thepiratecinemaclub[.]org NOTE: Do not attempt to visit this site.
Once on the system, a persistence mechanism in the form of a modified version of CpuTrace was dropped.
We found artifacts of a C2 proxy known as XTunnel on compromised systems.

There are more pressing matters than attribution here, but for the purposes of the challenge, name the APT!
