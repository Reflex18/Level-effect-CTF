In 2023, Cisco disclosed information about the active exploitation of a critical vulnerability in its software that allowed a remote, unauthenticated attacker to gain access to internet-facing network devices and create a local user account. This initial access paved the way for a privilege escalation vulnerability disclosed around the same time that would eventually lead to a full compromise of the system.

The first vulnerability received a CVSS score of 10.0 CRITICAL. The flag is the CVE identifier for that vulnerability.
