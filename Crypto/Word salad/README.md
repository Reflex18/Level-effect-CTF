## Method:

This one was a bit different then the others but had the same starting point.

I used our old friend cyber chef with the magic wand button to decode the first few steps.

This got us to something that looks like a flag but is in a jumbled state.

Since we know that the start has to be level effect and that there is numbers in it that it cannot be a substitute of characters.

So another option that i tried was to shift the characters using a ceaser cipher.

I used the following site and found the right shift of 13 letters.
