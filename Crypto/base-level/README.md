Method:

First i visited this website which is a great resource for ciphers and decoding challenges.
https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/


Then i pasted in the string and used the magic symbol to check what cyber chef recommends.

![[Cyber%20chef#20magic%20symbol.png]]


This converted from base 64.

Then i clicked it again to convert from base 32 which was recommended.

This then outputted the flag.

flag = leveleffect{two_to_the_five_two_to_the_six}

A very easy one using cyber chef and a great resource to use.
