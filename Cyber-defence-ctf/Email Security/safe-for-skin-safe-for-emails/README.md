# Safe for skin safe for emails...

## Description

I keep more than your skin safe. ðŸ˜ƒ

# Method:

This one was a bit trickier due to the lack description.

I first went to chat gpt and asked for a list of things that keep emails safe

Then i asked for a list of things that keep skin safe.

From that i saw that the spf for skin and the spf for emails had the same acronyms.

I checked it out and spf was the answer.

spf = sender policy framework
