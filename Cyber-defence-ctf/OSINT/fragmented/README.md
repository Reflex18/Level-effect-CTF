# Fragmented

## Description

It's a good habit to be suspicious of shortened links, but this one might be worth looking at a little more closely...

`https://bitly.cx/DwjQc`

# Method:

First i checked out the link itself and noticed in the url of the site is base64 code.

Decoding this brings out the following flag but wait a sec something looks wrong.

leveleffect{7B667234676d336e7435}

Decoding what is within the brackets shows the word fragments which i placed into another flag format.

flag = leveleffect{fr4gm3nt5}
