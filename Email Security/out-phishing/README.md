# Method:

To complete this challenge i first looked up email header information and how to identify where the country is from that sent the email.

This lead me to finding out that the last received by is the first country that sent the email. I then looked at the ip address of sender which was 193.217.1.27 and looked up a website that provided more info on ip addresses.

Then it provided the country from the ip address.
