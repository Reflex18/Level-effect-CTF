To figure out this challenge I took the three images of the QR code and used paint to merge them together.

Then I took a 4th piece of a random qr code and merged it into the qr codes to make a final one and used a site to decode it.

the site was: https://merri.cx/qrazybox/

The flag was leveleffect{r3dund4n7_d4t4}
