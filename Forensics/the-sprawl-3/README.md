# The Sprawl - 3

## Description

These IOCs were discovered on a compromised endpoint. Figure out the third flag by interacting with the binary.

*NOTE* - You can also access the challenge files on the `Cyber Defense CTF Triage Workstation` VM on our [hosted platform](https://training.leveleffect.com/courses/f4a9466f-edb0-42ff-bb0e-a95af2b05de5).

WARNING - This challenge has malware-like behavior involved. Do not run this on your personal machine. Use a VM in the Level Effect CTF course or your own. 

# Method

I attempted to run the program like normal but got stuck.

It seems the next part might need me to just cheat it like the snake game and look for strings

I used a tool called string cheese to find the flag
