# There's a snake in my boot!

## Description

A classic game of Snake, but the developer left the winning flag in the binary a little too exposed.

# Method:

This one was rather interesting but simple to answer.

Running the game and getting to a certain score just provides the player with a rick roll video but sadly no flag.

Instead if you open it with a text editor and search for the flag format it is easily found.
