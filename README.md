# Cyber Defence CTF

This capture the flag challenge was hosted by the Level Effect team to promote their Cyber Defence Analyst course. It was active for about three weeks and had a wide range of categories with a particular focus on blue teaming.

I completed several categories and have listed many of the challenges below that I completed with write-ups for them to show the method.

I had a great time with this CTF and managed to hit the top 100.
